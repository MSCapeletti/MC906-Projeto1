= Informed Search

* Heuristics

    They were a relevant parameter for our project. On Informed Search algorithms they are accounted within the path cost to serve as an evaluation that our agent will use to choose the next step it will take, the next action, and help to find a solution (sometimes optimal sometimes not) to our problem.
    For the Pacman Maze problem, our heuristics worked around finding the action that would take the agent to a less distant point to the goal.
    Searching on the bibliography and the internet we found two approaches taken on problems like these.

** Manhattan Distance

    Based on the "real" distance that the agent will travel. Considers the corners to be taken, like a count of steps. 
    It was necessary a little cost over the processing of it on each neighbor of the current node we were analyzing.
